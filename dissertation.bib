abstract="`Intrinsic' Hardware Evolution is the use of artificial evolution --- such as a Genetic Algorithm --- to design an electronic circuit automatically, where each fitness evaluation is the measurement of a circuit's performance when physically instantiated in a real reconfigurable VLSI chip. This paper makes a detailed case-study of the first such application of evolution directly to the configuration of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Evolution is allowed to explore beyond the scope of conventional design methods, resulting in a highly efficient circuit with a richer structure and dynamics and a greater respect for the natural properties of the implementation medium than is usual. The application is a simple, but not toy, problem: a tone-discrimination task. Practical details are considered throughout.",

abstract="Nature is phenomenal. The achievements in, for example, evolution are everywhere to be seen: complexity, resilience, inventive solutions and beauty. Evolvable Hardware (EH) is a field of evolutionary computation (EC) that focuses on the embodiment of evolution in a physical media. If EH could achieve even a small step in natural evolution's achievements, it would be a significant step for hardware designers. Before the field of EH began, EC had already shown artificial evolution to be a highly competitive problem solver. EH thus started off as a new and exciting field with much promise. It seemed only a matter of time before researchers would find ways to convert such techniques into hardware problem solvers and further refine the techniques to achieve systems that were competitive with or better than human designs. However, 15 years on---it appears that problems solved by EH are only of the size and complexity of that achievable in EC 15 years ago and seldom compete with traditional designs. A critical review of the field is presented. Whilst highlighting some of the successes, it also considers why the field is far from reaching these goals. The paper further redefines the field and speculates where the field should go in the next 10 years.",

abstract="We propose to utilize a formal verification algorithm to reduce the fitness evaluation time for evolutionary post-synthesis optimization in evolvable hardware. The proposed method assumes that a fully functional digital circuit is available. A post-synthesis optimization is then conducted using Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) which utilizes a satisfiability problem solver to decide whether a candidate solution is functionally correct or not. It is demonstrated that the method can optimize digital circuits of tens of inputs and thousands of gates. Furthermore, the number of gates was reduced for the LGSynth93 benchmark circuits by 37.8{\%} on average with respect to results of the conventional SIS tool.",

It has been shown to produce highly unconventional but extremely compact FPGA configurations for simple tasks, but these circuits are usually not robust enough to be useful: they malfunction if used on a slightly different FPGA, or at a different temperature. After defining an `operational envelope' of robustness, the feasibility of performing fitness evaluations in widely varying physical conditions in order to provide a selection-pressure for robustness is demonstrated. Preliminary experimental results are encouraging.",

Since the majority of transistors in a typical FPGA are dedicated to interconnect, nearly 80{\%} according to one estimate, evolutionary fault-recovery systems should benefit by accommodating routing. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary fault-recovery system employing a genetic representation that takes into account both logic and routing configurations. Experiments were run using a software model of the Xilinx Virtex FPGA. We report that using four Virtex combinational logic blocks, we were able to evolve a 100{\%} accurate quadrature decoder finite state machine in the presence of a stuck-at-zero fault.",

abstract="Living beings are complex systems exhibiting a range of desirable qualifications that have eluded realization by traditional engineering methodologies. In recent years we are witness to a growing interest in Nature exhibited by engineers, wishing to imitate the observed processes, thereby creating powerful problem-solving methodologies. If one considers Life on earth since its very beginning, three levels of organization can be distinguished: the phylogenetic level concerns the temporal evolution of the genetic programs within individuals and species, the ontogenetic level concerns the developmental process of a single multicellular organism, and the epigenetic level concerns the learning processes during an individual organism's lifetime. In analogy to Nature, the space of bioinspired systems can be partitioned along these three axes, phylogeny, ontogeny, and epigenesis, giving rise to the POE model. This paper is an exposition and examination of bio-inspired systems within the POE framework. We first discuss each of the three axes separately, considering the systems created to date and plotting directions for continued progress along the axis in question. We end our exposition by a discussion of possible research directions, involving the construction of bio-inspired systems that are situated along two, and ultimately all three axes. This presents a vision for the future which will see the advent of novel systems, inspired by the powerful examples provided by Nature.",

title="Understanding Inherent Qualities of Evolved Circuits: Evolutionary History as a Predictor of Fault Tolerance",
booktitle="Evolvable Systems: From Biology to Hardware",
year="2000",
publisher="Springer Berlin Heidelberg",
address="Berlin, Heidelberg",
pages="133--144",
abstract="Electronic circuits exhibit inherent qualities, which are due to the nature of the design process rather than any explicit behavioural specifications. Circuits designed by artificial evolution can exhibit very different inherent qualities to those designed by humans using conventional techniques. It is argued that some inherent qualities arising from the evolutionary approach can be beneficial if they are understood. As a case study, the paper seeks to determine the underlying mechanisms that produce one possible inherent quality, `Populational Fault Tolerance', by using various strategies including the observation of constituent components used throughout evolutionary history. The strategies are applied to over 80 evolved circuits and provide strong evidence to support an hypothesis --- that Population Fault Tolerance arises from the incremental nature of the evolutionary design process. The hypothesis is used to predict whether a given fault should manifest the quality, and is accurate in over 80{\%} of cases.",
