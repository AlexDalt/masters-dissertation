Firstly, I would like to thank Prof. Seth Bullock for his invaluable
advice and guidance throughout this project.
Thanks is also owed to the various members of the computer science department
who dissuaded me from working with a physical FPGA, and convinced me to play to my strengths
and operate firmly within software. I would be amis if I didn't also extend
my appreciation to my family, who's unwavering food supplies were surpassed in value only by
their blind appreciation for the work I have been producing.
