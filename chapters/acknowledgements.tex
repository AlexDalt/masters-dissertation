It is common practice (although totally optional) to acknowledge any
third-party advice, contribution or influence you have found useful
during your work.  Examples include support from friends or family, 
the input of your Supervisor and/or Advisor, external organisations 
or persons who  have supplied resources of some kind (e.g., funding, 
advice or time).

Firstly, I would like to thank Prof. Seth Bullock for his invaluable
advice and guidance throughout this project.
Thanks is also owed to the various members of the computer science department
who dissuaded me from working with a physical FPGA, and convinced me to play to my strengths
and opperate firmly within software. I would be amis if I didn't also extend
my appreciation to my family, who's unwavering food supplies were suppassed in value only by
their blind appreciation for the work I have been producing.
