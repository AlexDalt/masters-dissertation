The concluding chapter of a dissertation is often underutilised because it
is too often left too close to the deadline: it is important to allocation
enough attention.  Ideally, the chapter will consist of three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\item (Re)summarise the main contributions and achievements, in essence
      summing up the content.
\item Clearly state the current project status (e.g., ``X is working, Y
      is not'') and evaluate what has been achieved with respect to the
      initial aims and objectives (e.g., ``I completed aim X outlined
      previously, the evidence for this is within Chapter Y'').  There
      is no problem including aims which were not completed, but it is
      important to evaluate and/or justify why this is the case.
\item Outline any open problems or future plans.  Rather than treat this
      only as an exercise in what you {\em could} have done given more
      time, try to focus on any unexplored options or interesting outcomes
      (e.g., ``my experiment for X gave counter-intuitive results, this
      could be because Y and would form an interesting area for further
      study'' or ``users found feature Z of my software difficult to use,
      which is obvious in hindsight but not during at design stage; to
      resolve this, I could clearly apply the technique of Smith [7]'').
\end{enumerate}

\section{Evolution good}
better than bruteforce
mention things set out to do and address challenges
identified key scaling issues

\section{Evolution bad}
Intermittent leap from primordeal soup
coevolution doesnt work
elitism non-optional
coevolution not yet a viable means of improving scaling

\section{Summary of Achievments}

Direct comparison to other work

\section{Project state}
Completed initial aims

\section{Further work}
Malleable HW, alternate ML algorithms, change mutation step to be context specific (translation/rotation
of cells)

Be aggressivly critical, cannot be practical until this this and this is overcome
talk about upload times

As demonstrated by the fault injection, directing the the genetic algorithm
to devise concise compact solutions early on could dramatically improve performance.

Combining in-situe evolvable hardware and HW evolution accelerators
to take the results from the fault experiments and devise hardware
capable of self-healing.

One can pre-load a chip with a working configuration, and when the system detects a fault which hurts performace, or space for optimisation the design is itterated over. Factoring in user data and contextual runtime information.
